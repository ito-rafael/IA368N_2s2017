function [f, F_x, F_u] = transitionFunction(x,u, l)
% [f, F_x, F_u] = transitionFunction(x,u,l) predicts the state x at time t given
% the state at time t-1 and the input u at time t. F_x denotes the Jacobian
% of the state transition function with respect to the state evaluated at
% the state and input provided. F_u denotes the Jacobian of the state
% transition function with respect to the input evaluated at the state and
% input provided.
% State and input are defined according to "Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots", pp. 337
